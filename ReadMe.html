	<h2>Modification</h2>

	<ol>
		<li>All your modifications must be between the markers:<br>
			<code>#DO_NOT_EDIT_ANYTHING_ABOVE_THIS_LINE</code><br> <code>
				#DO_NOT_EDIT_ANYTHING_BELOW_THIS_LINE</code><br> All changes in other
			places will be lost.
		</li>
		<li>If you modify/delete the markers, we will not be able to
			extract your answer, and you may receive zero. <font color="red"><b>SO,
					DON'T TOUCH THE MARKERS.</b></font>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Testing during exam</h2>
	You are given some example cases in each question to check your outputs during exam. It will give a
	sense of what is expected.
	<ul>
		<li>Note that these cases do not cover all possible cases to be used in grading.</li>
		<li>These cases may or may not be used in grading. So passing these do not guarantee to get full score
			in the exam.</li>
		<li>There may be additional cases that we expect you to think about, and not explicitly mentioned in the question.</li>
		<li>Do not print any additional/unnecessary things as output. Your outputs should exactly match with the test case outputs. </li>

	</ul>
	<h2>Submission</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>We will grade only your <i>last</i> submission before the deadline. All
			submissions after the deadline will be simply ignored.</li>
		<li>Make sure your code does not give any errors before you submit.</li>
		<li>It is recommended that you submit your code every time you make progress like giving correct output on a case.</li>
	</ul>
